# RailsJunction

## Rails 7.1 application, using Sidekiq, Stimulus and Redis.

### Open plan application currently based around junctions (as the name suggests), locations and cities. Plan to integrate some graph functionality later down the line of development.

#### Using GitHub Actions to assess the application against workflow jobs per each push into the repository. Build and bundler-audit jobs passing, various different Ruby versions matrix now passing due to new RSpec setup.
